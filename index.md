## About  
I am currently director of Artificial Intelligence Research at Ieso Digital Health. Previously I was a Senior Research Associate in the [NLIP group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge where I worked on [automated language teaching and assessment](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/). I have a PhD in Information Retrieval from the [University of Ireland, Galway](https://nuig.github.io/). I was an IRCSET Marie-Curie fellow in the [Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/) at the University of Glasgow. My broad research interests are in the area of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
