**About**    
I am currently vice president of Artificial Intelligence at [ieso](https://ieso.ai/). Previously I was a Senior Research Associate in the [NLIP group](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/nl/) at the University of Cambridge where I worked on [automated language teaching and assessment](http://alta.cambridgeenglish.org/). I have a PhD in Information Retrieval from the [University of Ireland, Galway](https://nuig.github.io/) and was an [IRCSET Marie-Curie fellow](https://www.iua.ie/for-researchers/marie-sklodowska-curie-actions/) in the [Information Retrieval Group](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/informationretrieval/) at the University of Glasgow. My broad research interests are in the area of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence.
